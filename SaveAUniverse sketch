1. Them:  
    :       They're aliens
            They are six of them
            Mission: Attack the earth: 

        Weakness(es): 
            They are too logical
            They attack one at a time
            They wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another 
             alien ship.



2. Me:
            Captain of the USS Assembly, 
            strength: I have initiative and get to attack first
            weakness: no targetting lasers
            Attack aliens in order
            Mission: destroy every last alien ship.

3.  After I have destroyed a ship, I have the option to make a hasty retreat.


hull should be > 0 // less than 0 means destroyed
accuracy- should be 0-1 

                        USS Assembly:                     Alien (use math.random)

hull                    20                             B/w 3 and 6
firepower               5                              B/w 2 and 4
accuracy               .7                              B/w .6and .8



1. hull is the same as hitpoints. If hull reaches 0or less, the ship is destroyed

2.firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit

3. accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target.


create a function to generate the aliens
Create a function to randomize values for their properties
create a function to iterate over the six ships
create an object of captain USS ASSEMBLY
Create an object/class for the Alienships
create a function to determine when the next alien will be deployed
create a function to determine when Captain USS attacks
How do I tie all these together???????
